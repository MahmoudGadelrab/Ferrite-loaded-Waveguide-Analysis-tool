# Ferrite-loaded-Waveguide-Analysis-tool
We have developed an analysis tool to focused on the ferrite loaded rectangular waveguide. The calculations for this paper were done entirely using this Matlab code that solves the transcendental equation. Moreover, this code solves the transcendental equation in the complex domain to find both propagation and attenuation. One more advantage for this code is that one can see the response for the transcendental equation by changing any of the following parameters, Frequency (f) Magnetic Biasing (H_o) or the Position of the ferrite slab (C). In order to facilitate the use of the program, a graphical user interface (GUI) was created, where the  developed tool is uploaded for open access and public use. One can choose the analysis for phase shifters or isolators. For the phase shifter analysis, there are multiple options to solve your phase shifter. One can plot the response by changing any of these parameters (Frequency 'f,', magnetic biasing 'Ho,' or the position of the ferrite in the waveguide 'c'). Regarding the isolator analysis, the program solves its response versus the frequency or the position of the ferrite slab in the waveguide.

Some screen-shots from the developed tool are uploaded here including the start page for the GUI where one can choose the analysis for phase shifters or isolators.
